## Adding a New Project

When adding a new project to this repository, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Create a dedicated directory**: Each project should have its own directory with a descriptive name
   - Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `web-scraper`, `game-of-life`)

2. **Include a README**: Every project directory should contain a README.md file with:
   - Project title and brief description
   - Technologies/languages used
   - How to run/build the project
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Screenshots or examples (if applicable)

3. **Keep it self-contained**: Each project should be independent and runnable on its own

4. **Add appropriate dependencies**: Document all dependencies in the project's README

5. **Clean code**: Follow best practices for the language you're using
   - Include comments where necessary
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Structure code logically

├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py (optional)
